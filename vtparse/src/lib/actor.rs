/// `VTActor` is a trait that allows the host application to process
/// the different kinds of sequence as they are parsed from the input
/// stream.
///
/// The functions defined by this trait correspond to the actions defined
/// in the [state machine](https://vt100.net/emu/dec_ansi_parser).
///
/// ## Terminology:
/// An intermediate is a character in the range 0x20-0x2f that
/// occurs before the final character in an escape sequence.
///
/// `ignored_excess_intermediates` is a boolean that is set in the case
/// where there were more than two intermediate characters; no standard
/// defines any codes with more than two.  Intermediates after
/// the second will set this flag and are discarded.
///
/// `params` in most of the functions of this trait are decimal integer parameters in escape
/// sequences.  They are separated by semicolon characters.  An omitted parameter is returned in
/// this interface as a zero, which represents the default value for that parameter.
///
/// Other jargon used here is defined in
/// [ECMA-48](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-48,%202nd%20Edition,%20August%201979.pdf).
pub trait VTActor {
    /// The current code should be mapped to a glyph according to the character set mappings and
    /// shift states in effect, and that glyph should be displayed.
    ///
    /// If the input was UTF-8 then it will have been mapped to a unicode code point.  Invalid
    /// sequences are represented here using the unicode REPLACEMENT_CHARACTER.
    ///
    /// Otherwise the parameter will be a 7-bit printable value and may be subject to mapping
    /// depending on other state maintained by the embedding application.
    ///
    /// ## Some commentary from the state machine documentation:
    /// GL characters (20 to 7F) are
    /// printed. 20 (SP) and 7F (DEL) are included in this area, although both codes have special
    /// behaviour. If a 94-character set is mapped into GL, 20 will cause a space to be displayed,
    /// and 7F will be ignored. When a 96-character set is mapped into GL, both 20 and 7F may cause
    /// a character to be displayed. Later models of the VT220 included the DEC Multinational
    /// Character Set (MCS), which has 94 characters in its supplemental set (i.e. the characters
    /// supplied in addition to ASCII), so terminals only claiming VT220 compatibility can always
    /// ignore 7F. The VT320 introduced ISO Latin-1, which has 96 characters in its supplemental
    /// set, so emulators with a VT320 compatibility mode need to treat 7F as a printable
    /// character.
